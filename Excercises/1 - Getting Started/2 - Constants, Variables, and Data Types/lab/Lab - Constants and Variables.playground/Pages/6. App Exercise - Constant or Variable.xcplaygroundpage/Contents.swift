 ## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
 - Name: The user's name
 - Age: The user's age
 - Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
 - Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
 - Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours
 */
let name = "Henk"
print("constant because name doesn't change")
var age = 40
print("variable because age changes over time")
var numberOfStepsTaken = 2000
print("variable because the number of steps taken today changes over time")
let goalSteps = 20000
print("constant because the goal number of steps to take each day stays the same over time")
var averageHeartRate = 84
print("variable because over time the last 24 hour average will be changing")
/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
